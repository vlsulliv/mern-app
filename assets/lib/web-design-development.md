TEMPLATE DESIGN:
A template design uses a ready-made template that is further adjusted to suit the needs of a certain website.

Advantages of a template design:
faster development and adaptation
template designs usually come with a pre-built content management system (CMS)
even the earliest stages of web design development allow predicting the looks of the design-to-be

Disadvantages of a template design:
unoriginal image that will heavily resemble other websites that use templates
templates can be only changes to certain degree
not all the templates can provide all the functions necessary to a website
templates include their own page layouts, which is not always easily changeable
It must be taken into consideration that introducing vast and detailed changes in a template design demands as much time as developing an original website design. In this case, if the development of a template design takes too much time, it might be beneficial to switch to creating an original design.

ORIGINAL DESIGN:
An original design is a design that is developed from scratch, without using templates or any other ready-made structures.

Advantages of an original design:
unique looks that are easily distinguishable amongst other companies
an original design allows bringing to life almost any wishes of the client, whether visual or functional
such a design can be adjusted to serve any purpose and perform any function

Disadvantages of an original design:
an original design development takes more time
REPLICATED DESIGN
A replicated design is developed as an original design, but based on already existing examples. This design is a middle path between an original and a template designs.

Advantages of replicated design:
even the earliest stages of web design development allow predicting the looks of the design-to-be
ready-made ideas make the development of this particular design a lot faster
it is possible that successful design solutions will also be beneficial for the new website that utilizes them

Disadvantages of replicated design:
the development of a replicated design take almost as much time, as the development of an original design does
depending on how precisely the example design is copied, a replicated design may look more or less original

ADVANTAGES OF A HIGH-QUALITY DESIGN:
The development of a high-quality design allows presenting one's products, attracting new clients, as well as distinguishing oneself amongst competitors. Nowadays, when the internet is one of the most marketing and advertising tools, a unique and attractive design can become the decisive point in scoring a victory against one's competition.

VISUALS:
Web-site visuals and graphics are, broadly speaking, any non-textual part of a web-site. an image, photo, video, etc. Sometimes the term 'visuals' also includes text, as letter are, in fact, also images, the appearance of which - size, colour, line length and number - can vary.

Visuals are used to make a web-page more attractive, as well as to help a user find whatever he/she needs faster, as colourful images are good at drawing attention. Besides that, visuals allow explaining complex ideas in a simple way. Thus, to show complex relations between to processes, web-sites often use charts.

ILLUSTRATIONS:
Illustrations are a type of visual tools, usually drawings, images or photographs, that are used to explain a certain idea visually, illustrate it. Thus, for example, an image of an apple besides a text about apples is an illustration, as its main purpose is to show how the described object looks.

Illustrations are also distinguished by the fact that, for them, the content is more important than the artistic value of an image. Thus, a photo of an apple is a more precise (therefore better) illustration of an apple, than a drawing of one, even is the drawing is artistically more pleasing.

ARTISTIC IMAGE:
An artistic image is a drawing or a photo, the main purpose of which is to be artistically pleasing, to decorate the web-site. Compared to illustrations, the task of artistic images is not to depict a certain object or idea in the most precise way, although it can also dot hat. Usually, artistic images are chosen according to the overall design of a web-site, not according to text or other content. Thus, for example, a decorative image of bananas, kiwis and pineapples is suitable on a fruit-dedicated web-site, even if a particular page is about apples.

POINTER:
A point is a type of visual tools, that draws attention to a certain part of a page or content, points to it. The main task of a pointer is to stand out, so that the user can easily notice it. Another task of a pointer is to point at the right place - sometimes it must draw attention to itself, but sometimes to a certain piece of nearby content. Although a pointer does not necessary need to be artistically pleasing, it is always worth making it fit into the overall design of web-site, or the page risks looking unprofessional.
