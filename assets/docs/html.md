# HTML

## Elements

HTML elements are defined by a starting tag `<h1>`, `<h2>`, paragraph tag `<p>`. If the element contains other contect, it ends with a closing tag. There are some elements that don't need to be closed, such as `<img.../>`, `<hr />` and `<br />` are known as `void elements`. These are known as void elements.

## Tags vs Elements

An HTML element is defined by a start tag and if it contains other content, it ends with a closing tag. The `<p>` is start tag of a paragraph element and `</p>` is closing tag of the same paragraph, but `<p>` This is a paragraph `</p>` is a paragraph elements.

An attribute is used to define charecteristics of a HTML element and is placed inside the elements opening tag. Attribute are made of two parts - a ``name`` and ``value``.

 - The name is the property you want to set.
 - The value is what you want the value of that property to be.
 
 ## Core Attributes

There are four core attribute that can be used on the majority of HTML elements -

 - Id
 - Title
 - Class
 - Style
 
> __The ID Attibute__  

The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identift any element within the HTML page.

> __The Title Attribute__  

Gives a sugested title for the element. The syntax is similar as explained for id attribute. The behavior of this attribute will depend upon the element that carries it, although it is often displayed as a tooltip when cursor moves over it.

> __The Class Attribute__  

Used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class of the element.

> __The Style Attribute__  

Allows you to specify CSS rules within the element.
 

## Internationalization Attributes

There are three internationalization attributes, which are available for most (although not all) XHTML elements.

 - dir
 - lang
 - xml:lang
 
> __The dir Attribute__  

The dir attribute allows you to indicate to the browser about the direction in which the text should flow. The dir attribute can take one of two values, as you can see in the table that follows −

| `Value`	| `Meaning` |  
| - | - |  
| ltr	| Left to right (the default value) |  
| rtl	| Right to left (for languages such as Hebrew or Arabic that are read right to left) |  
 
> __The lang Attribute__  

The lang attribute allows you to indicate the main language used in a document, but this attribute was kept in HTML only for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of HTML. This attribute has been replaced by the xml:lang attribute in new XHTML documents.

The values of the lang attribute are ISO-639 standard two-character language codes. Check HTML Language Codes: ISO 639 for a complete list of language codes.

## Text Format

Word processors have the ability to change how texts appear in HTML and XHTML. There are ten elements available to change the text appearance.

Bold: `<b>...</b>`  
Italic: `<i>...</i> `  
Line-through: `<strike>...</strike> `  
monospaced font: `<tt>...</tt>`  
superscript: `<sup>...</sup>`  
subscript: `<sub>...</sub>`  
insert" `<ins>...</ins>`  
delete: `<del>...</del>`  
1 size bigger: `<big>...</big>`  
1 size smaller: `<small>...</small>`  

## Grouping Content

- span
 
> __div__

used to group elements that are being used to format a section of the page.

> __Span__

can be used to group inline elements only.
